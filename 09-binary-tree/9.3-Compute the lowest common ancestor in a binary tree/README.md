# 9.3-Compute the lowest common ancestor in a binary tree

>  1 keep the update rule in mind. If the program stagnateï¼Œ pay more attention to update rule cause that might be wrong.

>  2 use head's previous node as pivot

>  3 comment on how you going to solve the problem then show a test case. 

>  4 keep compiling while programming.

>  5 be careful about stack push and pop elements' order.

>  6 don't use stack if you can use vector instead.

>  7 for dfs, you can try recursion or use stack.

>  8 Instead of updating by the end, keep updating step by step while you are adding elements.

>  9 Write comments before you write code.

>  10 Always check before manipulating.

>  11 Be clear about which elements you want to compared.

>  12 Be clear about what is the output based on. It is very important.


The output at each node is only based on itself and its children, nothing from the parent node.
